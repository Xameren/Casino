## Casino game list
**Roulette**

**Slots**
A game where a slot mashine is spinned and stopped. You have to get the same symbols multiple times for a payout.
**Horse betting**
A horse race will start and you have to predict the horse which will win the race.

**Coinflip**
A coin is flipped and you have to bet on the side you think the coin will land on.
**Crash**
Your bet is multiplied each second and you have to cash out before the game "crashes" and you lose your bet.
