A game where a slot mashine is spinned and stopped. You have to get the same symbols multiple times for a payout.<br>
**Horse betting**<br>
A horse race will start and you have to predict the horse which will win the race.<br>
**Casino war**<br>

**Coinflip**<br>
A coin is flipped and you have to bet on the side you think the coin will land on.<br>
**Crash**<br>
Your bet is multiplied each second and you have to cash out before the game "crashes" and you lose your bet.<br>
**Keno**<br>
